# MyLaps-infoscreen
Show lap times using data from a AMB or MyLaps decoder. This tool is designed to work offline without internet connection.

Originally it fetched the data from mylaps.com, but after a site change it has been rewritten to fetch data directly from the decoder.

It is designed to work without an internet connection, it has an option to fetch avatars and names from mylaps.com, but it can be disabled for offline use.
